# extended-preferences-compat
Base setup of support.v7.preference and AppCompat

support.v7.preference was made to work with AppCompat... unfortunately it was stripped from everything related to dealing with Fragments (displaying preference sub-screens, DialogPreferences, ...).
ExtendedPreferencesCompat is implementing those gaps, bringing support.v7.preference's functionality closer to the native preferences.
